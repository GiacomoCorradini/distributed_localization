## Project 1

Given:

- Position of robot 1 via GPS
- Position of robot 2 via GPS
- Angle between the forward direction of robot 1 and the object via camera
- Angle between the forward direction of robot 2 and the object via camera

Estimate:

- Position of robot 1
- Position of robot 2
- Position of the object

## Project 2

Given:

- Angle between the forward direction of robot 1 and the objects via cameras
- Angle between the forward direction of robot 2 and the objects via cameras

Estimate:

- Relative position of robot 2 with respect to robot 1
- Position of the objects
